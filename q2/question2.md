#### Focus Mobile Backend Take Home Challenge Question 2
Cheap Stocks, Inc is pleased with the application so far and would like to create an app to track stocks using third-party APIs. The company would also like to incorporate internationalization using supported currencies and languages.
To save money, the CEO wants you to obtain free api keys from currencylayer and fixer to convert currencies if needed. If one service fails, then fallback to the other if possible.
